## About the Collection

This collection is a set of recipes, some handwritten and some typed up, that are tasty and well loved.  Each recipe started as a family recipe or an online recipe but then has undergone testing and revisions in the kitchen.  I like to see recipes as a form of oral tradition that eventually gets written down to help share it and gets updated as needed.  

Recipes were chosen regardless of complexity or subject.  I grabbed a handful off the magnets pinning them to my cabinets and so we have a cross-section of different food types and more that is loosely representative of the recipes in the kitchen.
